One of the main benefits of the Gitflow workflow is the ability to participate in parallel development. 
This means that you can work on multiple facets of the project, or multiple projects at once. 
The Gitflow workflow makes parallel development possible by isolating any development from work that is already completed. 
Development work is done in different branches.
