Branch - A branch is essentially a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches.
This is the official working version of your project, and the one you see when you visit the project repository at github.com/yourname/projectname. 
Do not mess with the master. An example of how to use git branching would be:

Git branch name(whatever name you want the branch to be called).
