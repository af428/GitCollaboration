Merge - Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. 
The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. 
The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. An Example of a merge would be:

git merge name

Using the same picture from Master branch works in this situation because you are merging both your work and someone else's onto the master branch.
