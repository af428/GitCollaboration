Pull - being able to download content from a remote repository and have it update your local repository to match that content. 
When someone makes changes to the remote repository that everyone is working on, you need to pull the latest version so your local is up to date. An example of this is:
git pull <remote>
This pulls the remote version and merges it with your local immediately.
